This is a simple Bull's Eye game created as part of the Ray Wenderlich iOS & Swift Learning Path over at https://www.raywenderlich.com/ios/paths/learn

## Focus

## Running The Application
The app was created with XCode. In order to run the application, open the Bullseye.xcodeproj in Xcode.

## Playing Bull's Eye
A game of precision. The aim is to get the slider position as close to the target number as you can. Points are given based on how far off the target number the player is. Bonus points are given when a player is real close & even more when it's exact!
